[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Yonaba/Moses.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Yonaba/Moses)

A utility library which provides a set of helpers acting as shortcuts for common programming tasks,
and support for [functional programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming). It complements the built-in __Lua table library__, making easier operations on arrays, lists, 
collections, objects, through 98 odd functions.<br/>
__Moses__ was deeply inspired by [Underscore.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/).

##Usage##
Put the file [Moses.lua](https://github.com/Yonaba/Moses/blob/master/moses.lua) inside your project folder and call it using *require* command.

__Note__: 
The full source [moses.lua](https://github.com/Yonaba/Moses/blob/master/moses.lua) is quite heavy (approximately 50 kiB).<br/>
You can alternatively use the lighter [minified version](https://github.com/Yonaba/Moses/blob/master/moses_min.lua) (16 kiB).

##Usage examples##
Find a complete set of samples in [moses.md](https://github.com/Yonaba/Moses/blob/master/docs/moses.md)
  
##Documentation##
A fully complete documentation, in HTML-format, can be found in [Docs](https://github.com/Yonaba/Moses/blob/master/docs), and is also available for [download](http://github.com/Yonaba/Moses/downloads). <br/>
